# Seamless Shipment Tool
The shipment application will consist of a library designed to mock shipments.
It will accept a set of options and in real-time create mocked deliveries.
This will be used to perform high level testing.


## Features
  *TODO*


## Getting Started
this section describes common scripts that can be used.

  - continuously build and serve: `npm start`.
  - continuously test: `npm test`.
  - continuously document: `npm run docs`.
  - build app: `npm run build`.
  - test once: `npm run mocha`.
  - create docs: `npm run document`.
  - deploy app: `npm run deploy`.
  - update dependancies: `npm i`.


## Testing
testing will be conducted using mocha. specs will be placed in the same
directory as the code they are testing and will be noted as '/spec.js?/'


## Code Style
to maintain code style we will be using es-lint in combination with
the airbnb base configurations.


## Documentation
to generate documentation we are using esdocs. please see
[here](https://esdoc.org/tutorial.html). Also it is worth looking for a editor
plugin to help generate templates for docs (for atom try: atom-easy-jsdoc. it
doesnt work perfectly but atleast decent).
